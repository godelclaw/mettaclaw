# Run an independent agent instance

The templates in this directory separate the cognitive loop, Telegram transport,
operator controls and optional execution gateway. Each has its own lifetime;
restarting cognition need not disconnect the operator channel.

These instructions describe `integration/upstream-modes-20260930`. Begin with
the [project setup](../README.md#get-started). The durable Telegram service also
needs a built CeTTa service host and its configured `channel` application root;
this repository supplies the client, command definitions and launch wrapper,
not an automatic installer for that host bundle.

## Choose an instance name and layout

Use a short instance name such as `research`. It identifies services and state,
while the agent's conversational identity comes from its private prompt.
Repeat the layout with a different name for another instance.

| Template convention | Example for `research` |
|---|---|
| Checkout `%h/pettaclaw-%i` | `~/pettaclaw-research` |
| Channel environment | `~/.config/pettaclaw/research-channel.env` |
| Runtime environment | `~/.config/pettaclaw/research-runtime.env` |
| Bot credential | `~/.config/cetta-telegram-credentials/research/token` |
| Transport state | systemd's user state directory, `cetta-telegram-research/` |
| Private sockets | systemd's user runtime directory, `cetta-telegram-research/client.sock` and `operator.sock` |

`%h`, `%i`, `%t` and `%S` are systemd specifiers. The `pettaclaw` filenames are
retained interface names; the project is MeTTaClaw. If your checkout lives
elsewhere, adapt the unit's `WorkingDirectory` and `ExecStart` together.

Initialize with the same instance name that the services will use:

```sh
cd ~/pettaclaw-research
METTACLAW_INSTANCE=research ./initialize.sh
```

Edit `config/local.toml`, `config/secrets.env` and `memory/prompt.txt` for this
instance, then repeat initialization. Use separate credentials and state for
each instance. The templates share code, not agent memories.

## Configure the channel and runtime

The channel environment must supply these values:

| Setting | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `CETTA_TELEGRAM_SERVICE_BIN` | Absolute path to the built durable Telegram service executable. |
| `CETTA_TELEGRAM_SERVICE_ROOT` | Application root containing the configured `channel` program for that service. |
| `METTACLAW_TELEGRAM_OPERATOR_IDS` | Comma-separated operator user IDs. |
| `METTACLAW_TELEGRAM_PRIMARY_CHAT_ID` | Default private destination for this instance. |
| `METTACLAW_TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_CHAT_IDS` | Additional permitted chats, when needed. |

Store the bot token as the sole content of the credential file. systemd supplies
it through `LoadCredential`; the service launcher passes its filename to the
host. Keep credentials and both environment files private, outside Git.
`EnvironmentFile` values must contain actual paths: shell variables and `~`
are not expanded there.

In `config/local.toml`, set `[telegram]` to `transport = "durable"`,
`client = "metta"`, and `service_socket` to this instance's **client** socket.
This socket is also used by the command responder. Configure identical routing
and authorization values in the channel environment and `config/secrets.env`.
The separate operator socket is reserved for the service's administrative
interface.

The runtime environment can supply instance-specific engine, mode, model,
lifecycle and gateway settings. Use the same values for cognition and the
command responder. Both run through `run.sh`, which loads the generated `.env`
and then `config/secrets.env`; avoid conflicting values across these files.
With `METTACLAW_SKIP_INITIALIZE=1`, rerun initialization after changing the TOML.

## Install the reusable services

Copy these templates into your user systemd directory:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
cp systemd/cetta-telegram@.socket systemd/cetta-telegram@.service \
  systemd/pettaclaw-telegram-control@.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
```

Provide a cognition unit for your instance. For example, save the following as
`~/.config/systemd/user/pettaclaw@.service`:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=MeTTaClaw cognition (%i)
Wants=network-online.target cetta-telegram@%i.service pettaclaw-telegram-control@%i.service
After=network-online.target cetta-telegram@%i.service pettaclaw-telegram-control@%i.service

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=%h/pettaclaw-%i
Environment=METTACLAW_INSTANCE=%i
Environment=METTACLAW_SKIP_INITIALIZE=1
EnvironmentFile=%h/.config/pettaclaw/%i-runtime.env
EnvironmentFile=%h/.config/pettaclaw/%i-channel.env
ExecStart=%h/pettaclaw-%i/run.sh
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
KillMode=control-group
TimeoutStopSec=20

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Set `METTACLAW_INSTANCE=research` in `research-runtime.env` too, so the command
responder uses the same instance name. Keep provider credentials in the
instance's `config/secrets.env`. The transport and responder remain independent
of cognition: the example uses startup dependencies, without `PartOf` or a
shared service control group.

Once the configured files and host bundle are in place:

```sh
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now cetta-telegram@research.socket
systemctl --user enable --now cetta-telegram@research.service
systemctl --user enable --now pettaclaw-telegram-control@research.service
systemctl --user enable --now pettaclaw@research.service
```

Check each unit's status and journal separately. `/modes` should answer through
the independent responder, including while cognition is stopped. `/mode iter`
or `/mode omega` selects the loop for the next supervised cognition process.
Both require the durable channel; the responder always executes on CeTTa.

## Optional services and existing deployment examples

The [execution gateway](../src/execution_gateway/README.md) has its own
`pettaclaw-gateway@.service` template and configuration. Start it separately,
then configure the instance's gateway socket and agent ID. It is optional for
the supplied loops.

The non-template units and deployment watcher files predate this reusable
layout. They encode a particular installation and are not defaults to copy
unchanged. Likewise, `src/sibling.py` currently contains a fixed two-peer map;
it is not a general multi-instance registry. Ordinary mode operation does not
require peer control. Adapt that optional integration separately if you need it.

For expected request, checkpoint and restart behavior, see the
[mode guide](../modes/README.md). For fixture-based checks of the service boundary,
see `tests/test_durable_telegram_service.py` and
`tests/test_mode_control_boundary.py`.
