"""One table for every constant that lives in more than one artifact.

The rest/heartbeat regression survived for months because two Lean models
described a loop that had changed underneath them. The guard that was
supposed to catch that class of drift — test_constants_regression.sh —
pointed at a different agent's files and grepped for a pattern that no
longer existed anywhere, so it found nothing, printed a warning, and
passed. A guard that can silently match nothing is decoration.

Hence the one rule here: a source that is PRESENT but whose pattern does
not match is a failure, not a skip. Only a genuinely absent file (the Lean
models are in a separate repo) is skipped, and a group needs two readable
sources before it can claim to have cross-checked anything.

To pin a new shared constant, add a row. That is the whole mechanism.
