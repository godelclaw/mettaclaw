"""Run Claude Code headless (claude -p) on the agent's behalf, gated by the
operator's authorization flag.

The flag is a file the operator flips from Telegram (/claude_code_authorization)
or the shell; the skill reads it fresh on every call, so revocation is
immediate. The subprocess runs plain `claude -p` — interactive permission
prompts are simply absent, so anything that would need one is declined by
Claude Code itself; this bridge adds no permission bypasses.
