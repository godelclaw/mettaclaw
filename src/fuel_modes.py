"""Persistent fuel discipline: what a renewal does to the budget it finds.

Every grant site in the loop used to overwrite the budget with one full
burst, so a burst the agent had not spent was simply lost at the next
renewal and the budget could never exceed `full`. That is one choice among
several, and it encodes a claim: each interval is a fresh, equal breath and
restraint earns nothing.

The disciplines here make that claim selectable. Each is a function of the
budget currently held and the grant the policy offers:

  saturate    max(loops, grant)              — original behaviour, ceiling `grant`
  accumulate  loops + grant                  — unbounded; restraint compounds
  carry       min(CARRY * grant, loops+grant) — accumulate under a ceiling
  decay       loops * 3 // 4 + grant         — recency-weighted, same ceiling

`carry` and `decay` share the ceiling CARRY * grant and differ only in how
they approach it: carry accumulates at full rate and stops dead, decay
forgets a quarter of what it holds each renewal and converges. The decay
rate is 3/4 precisely so the two agree on the limit — the fixed point of
`x = 3x/4 + grant` is `4 * grant`.

The arithmetic is integer and total on purpose: the bounds are the content
of the choice, and `lean/pettaclaw/FuelPolicy.lean` proves each one against
exactly these definitions.

Human arming is deliberately not routed through here. It stays a plain
`max`: a message means work has arrived, and the communication layer grants
one breath to answer it rather than minting fuel.
