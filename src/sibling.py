"""Sibling-claw control: reliable start/stop/status for the other agent.

The two claws are meant to orchestrate each other, but "stop the sibling"
is only reliable if it also speaks the watchdog's pause convention: a
PAUSED-BY-OPERATOR.md marker in the sibling's body directory. Stopping the
service without the marker means the watchdog revives it within 30 minutes;
removing the marker without starting means it stays down until the next
watchdog pass. These helpers always do both halves, in the safe order
(marker before stop; marker removed before start), and report what actually
happened rather than what was attempted.

Which agent is "the sibling" is derived from this body's own directory, so
the same file serves both bodies unchanged.
