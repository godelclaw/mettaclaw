"""Persistent working-memory pins.

(pin ...) was catalog-only for its whole life: the unbound expression echoed
itself into the results feedback, which LOOKED like working memory but lived
only until it scrolled out — and died entirely on restart. The agent asked
for exactly this: "if pins survived restart, I'd wake up already knowing
what I was doing."

Pins live in a small file, newest last, hard-capped so the per-turn context
cost stays bounded (~1.5 KB worst case). The PINNED block in the context is
built from this file, so a restart changes nothing the agent can see.
