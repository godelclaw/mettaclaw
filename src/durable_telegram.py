"""Client of a durable CeTTa Telegram channel service (telegram-channel/1).

The service owns the bot's polling and sending. It records every received
update before this client sees it, and every submitted action before it is
sent, so neither survives only in this process. This client reads delivery
and receipt tasks, acknowledges each one after handling it, and submits keyed
action batches.

Protocol: CWP1 over a private Unix seqpacket socket. A packet is b"CWP1",
a code byte, an ID length byte, the ID and a UTF-8 body.
